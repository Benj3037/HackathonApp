A1. Access to Clean Cooking Fuels (% of Population): Start by addressing the percentage of the population with access to clean cooking fuels. This can be a critical factor for public health and the environment.

2. Renewable-Electricity-Generating-Capacity-Per-Capita: Explore the renewable electricity generation capacity per capita to highlight the transition toward cleaner energy sources.

3. Renewable Energy Share in Total Final Energy Consumption (%): Illustrate the share of renewable energy in the overall energy consumption, emphasizing the shift towards sustainability.

4. Electricity from Renewables (TWh): Highlight the absolute amount of electricity generated from renewable sources to showcase the impact of clean energy.

5. Value_CO2_Emissions_kt_by_Country: Show the CO2 emissions by country to provide context for the environmental impact.

6. Renewables (% Equivalent Primary Energy): Explore the percentage of renewables in the equivalent primary energy mix to emphasize the importance of clean energy sources.

7. GDP Growth and GDP per Capita: Examine the economic indicators like GDP growth and GDP per capita to understand how clean energy adoption relates to economic prosperity.

8. Access to Electricity (% of Population): Include access to electricity as a related factor, as it is often linked to energy development and clean energy adoption.

9. Latitude and Longitude: If there are geographic patterns in clean energy adoption, you can use latitude and longitude to create geographical visualizations.

10. Density (P/Km2) and Land Area (Km2): Consider including population density and land area to assess the impact of clean energy policies on densely populated areas or regions with significant land resources.
